DESCRIPTION
    This module allows the caller to tie an array which will then be stored
    on the disk.  This allows the same data to be used each time a program
    runs without having to manually restore the data.  Note that references
    are not allowed, because they will not reincarnate correctly between
    program invocations.  The rules are similar to hash keys.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
